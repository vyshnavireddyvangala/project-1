    <h1>Food & Hunger Relief</h1>
    <p>
      Hunger is one of the biggest challenges faced by underprivileged communities. 
      <strong>Mother Care Charity</strong> runs food drives and nutrition programs to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry.

      <h2>Food Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        Food distribution in charity work is supported by several humanitarian and social-welfare theories.
        From a humanitarian perspective, the Right to Food principle holds that everyone is entitled
        to adequate, safe, and nutritious food, and aid programs should respect dignity while meeting basic needs.
        The Sphere standards used in disaster relief add practical guidance, defining minimum requirements for calories, 
        protein and safe handling so that rations protect health and fairness.

      <h2>Nutrition Programs</h2>
      <p>
        Nutrition programs in charity and public health work draw on several well-established theories.
        One is Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which places adequate food close to the base of human requirements;
        without proper nutrition, people cannot focus on safety, learning, or long-term goals. Public-health 
        planning often uses the Social Ecological Model, showing that eating habits are shaped not only by individual 
        choice but also by family, community, and policy environments so programs must address all these layers.

      <h2>Emergency Relief</h2>
      <p>
        Emergency relief is the immediate assistance provided to people affected by crises such as floods,
        earthquakes, conflicts, or other disasters. Its goal is to save lives, reduce suffering, and protect 
        dignity until longer-term recovery efforts can begin. Relief includes essential supplies such as 
        drinking water, food, shelter materials, warm clothing, blankets, and basic medical care.

      <h2>Sustainable Food Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable food projects aim to fight hunger while protecting the environment and strengthening 
        local livelihoods. Instead of only handing out short-term rations, these programs focus on creating 
        lasting food security by helping communities grow, store, and market their own produce in ways that 
        care for natural resources.
